Version 1.14:
- Fixed an error that would occur when a slider specifies an icon in the snippet tuning.
- Fixed a corruption issue with the max Breast slider

Version 1.13:
- Fixed an error where the sliders got mixed up for Bony, Lean, Heavy, and Fit.

Version 1.12:
- Added a sub dialog when modifying a slider so that more options per slider can be added.
- Added the ability to remove a slider through a button click instead of having to manually enter a 0.0
- Fixed an issue when sending the new value for a slider via the event
- Added the ability to distinguish a face modifier from a body modifier via the slider snippets
- Many of the sliders that were previously face modifiers now apply as body modifiers instead, thus fixing a few issues like when you remove a slider only for the slider to not actually be removed.

Version 1.11:
- Fixed some issues with the Belly Shape Pregnancy sliders
- Added variants of the Belly Shape Pregnancy sliders that are available for Cat, Large Dog, Small Dog, and Fox
- When sliders are changed using the CSF Customize Sliders dialog, an event will now be sent out to notify any mods that care about slider changes.
- Fixed an issue with the Breast Size slider causing a gaping hole to appear in the chest of Sims at maximum size.
- Removed a few duplicate strings from the string table
- Separated the breast size sliders from the default sliders package because combining the breast size sliders with anything else seems to break it.

- Fixed sliders not properly applying when customizing them.

Version 1.9:
- Fixed the View Template option not properly showing the template values.

Version 1.8:
