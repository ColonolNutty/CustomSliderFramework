Version 1.6:
- Added a small dialog when there are no sliders found for a Sim or when the sliders are still loading upon opening the Customize Sliders dialog

Version 1.5:
- Overhauled the entire back-end for loading and querying Sliders, thus improving the load times as well as the performance of the mod.
- CSF now requires at least version 1.56 of Sims 4 Community Library
